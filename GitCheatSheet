#Git Cheat Sheet

git branch
- This will generate a list of branches associated with the repository

git checkout -b branchname
- This is used to checkout an existing branch associated the repository
- In my job we generally create branches in jira then use the checkout command locally to access that branch.

git commit
- This allows changes to committed to the current branch

git commit -m "message"
- Same as above but it allows the committer to add a message to the commit to refer back to.

git push
- This will "push" the commit to the branch in git rather than just remaining locally

git log
- This will generate a list of the commits that occurred in the current branch 

git status
- This will generate a list of all files and their status including staging and tracking

git init repositoryname
- this creates a blank git repository

git clone repositorylocation
- clones the repository at that location to the local computer

git stash
- This saves changes for a later commit
- In my job I use this when I want switch branches but don't want commit anything yet

git pull
- This will update any changes that were made in the working branch that another person may have made
